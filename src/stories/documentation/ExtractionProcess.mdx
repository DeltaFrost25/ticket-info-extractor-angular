# Ticket Extraction Process

This document explains the technical details of how the Ticket Information Extractor processes HTML files and extracts ticket information.

## Overview

The extraction process follows these key steps:

1. **HTML Cleaning**: Remove unnecessary elements and attributes to simplify processing
2. **Ticket Identification**: Locate ticket IDs following the 300-#### pattern
3. **Content Extraction**: Find and extract description, details, and resolution fields
4. **Deduplication**: Remove duplicate entries based on ticket ID

## HTML Cleaning

The application first cleans the input HTML to focus only on relevant content:

- Removes `<style>` and `<script>` tags and their contents
- Strips unnecessary attributes (keeping only id, data-caid, name, autoidentifier, value)
- Focuses on 'ext-comp-' elements that contain ticket information
- Preserves only title elements and textareas that contain important data

This cleaning process significantly reduces the HTML complexity and makes the extraction more reliable.

## Ticket Identification

Tickets are identified primarily by looking for the pattern '300-' followed by digits:

- Searches for this pattern in title elements with 'data-caid' attribute
- If not found in titles, searches in other text content
- Extracts the full ticket ID (e.g., '300-1234')

## Content Extraction

For each identified ticket, the application extracts three main pieces of information:

### Description
- Located in textareas with name, data-caid, id, or autoidentifier containing 'Description'
- Excludes fields that contain 'Long' in their identifiers

### Details
- Found in textareas with identifiers containing 'DescriptionLong' or 'Details'
- Usually contains more extensive information about the ticket

### Resolution
- Extracted from textareas with identifiers containing 'Resolution'
- Contains information about how the issue was resolved

## Deduplication

Since the same ticket might appear multiple times in the HTML, the application:

- Creates a set of unique ticket IDs
- Keeps only the first occurrence of each ticket ID
- Returns a deduplicated list of tickets

## Technical Implementation

The core of this process is implemented in `TicketDataService` with these main methods:

### cleanHtml()
```typescript
private cleanHtml(html: string): string {
  // Removes scripts, styles
  // Preserves only specific attributes
  // Keeps only relevant ext-comp elements
}
```

### extractTicketData()
```typescript
private extractTicketData(html: string): Ticket[] {
  // Finds ticket IDs
  // Extracts textarea content
  // Maps to description, details, resolution
  // Removes duplicates
}
```

### processHtmlFile()
```typescript
processHtmlFile(htmlContent: string): Ticket[] {
  // Main entry point
  // Cleans HTML then extracts data
}
```

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

The extraction process is designed to handle several edge cases:

- **Missing Fields**: If a description, details, or resolution is not found, it's stored as an empty string
- **Malformed HTML**: The Cheerio library helps parse even poorly structured HTML
- **Duplicates**: Only the first occurrence of each ticket ID is kept
- **Missing Ticket ID**: Elements without a recognizable ticket ID are skipped

## Testing

The extraction process has been tested with various HTML inputs to ensure reliability:

- Clean HTML files
- Complex HTML with nested elements
- HTML with multiple instances of the same ticket
- HTML with missing or partial ticket information

## Performance Considerations

For large HTML files:

- The initial cleaning significantly reduces processing time
- Using Cheerio for parsing is more efficient than regular expressions for complex HTML
- Deduplication helps manage large sets of tickets efficiently
