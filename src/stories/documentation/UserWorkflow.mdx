# User Workflow

This guide walks through the typical user workflow for extracting ticket information from HTML files.

## Step 1: Load the Application

When you first load the application, you'll see a clean interface with a file selection button:

```jsx
// Example component state - initial view
<TicketExtractorComponent />
```

## Step 2: Select an HTML File

Click the "Choose File" button to select an HTML file containing ticket information. The application supports any HTML file that contains ticket information in the expected format (containing 300-#### IDs in data elements).

```jsx
// User selects a file through the file dialog
// Once selected, the file is automatically processed
```

## Step 3: View Processing Results

The application will automatically process the HTML file and display the extracted tickets in a table:

```jsx
// Example of the application with processed data
<TicketExtractorComponent isLoading={false} tickets={[
  {
    ticketId: '300-1234',
    compId: 'ext-comp-1001',
    description: 'User login issue',
    details: 'Detailed problem description...',
    resolution: 'Fixed authentication flow'
  },
  // More tickets...
]} />
```

If no tickets are found or if there was an error processing the file, appropriate error messages will be displayed.

## Step 4: Copy Ticket Data

### Option 1: Copy Individual Fields

Click on any cell in the table to copy just that specific piece of information:

```jsx
// Example showing the copy action on a cell
<TicketTableComponent 
  tickets={[...]} 
  copiedField={{ ticketId: '300-1234', field: 'description' }} 
/>
```

When you click a cell, a brief "Copied!" message will appear to confirm the action.

### Option 2: Copy All Data

Click the "Copy All" button to copy all ticket information in a formatted text layout:

```jsx
// Example showing the copy all action
<TicketExtractorComponent tickets={[...]} copiedAll={true} />
```

The copied text will include all tickets with their IDs, descriptions, details, and resolutions in a structured format.

## Step 5: Clear or Process Another File

You can either:
- Click "Clear" to reset the form and start over
- Simply select another file to process a different HTML file

```jsx
// Example showing cleared state
<TicketExtractorComponent />
```

## Error Handling

The application handles several error conditions:

### Invalid File Type

If you select a non-HTML file:

```jsx
// Example showing file type error
<TicketExtractorComponent 
  errorMessage="Please select an HTML file." 
/>
```

### Processing Error

If there's an error reading or processing the file:

```jsx
// Example showing processing error
<TicketExtractorComponent 
  errorMessage="Error processing file: Unable to parse HTML content" 
/>
```

### No Tickets Found

If the file is processed successfully but no tickets are found:

```jsx
// Example showing no tickets found
<TicketExtractorComponent 
  tickets={[]} 
  errorMessage="No ticket information found in the file." 
/>
```

## Clipboard Support

The application implements multiple clipboard methods to ensure compatibility across different browsers and environments:

1. **Modern Clipboard API**: Uses `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` for modern browsers
2. **Fallback Method**: Uses `document.execCommand('copy')` with a temporary textarea for older browsers
3. **Visual Feedback**: Provides visual confirmation when content is copied

This ensures the copy functionality works consistently across different environments.
